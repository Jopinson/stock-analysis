# Stock Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to pull data on the stocks owned by the Green family and determine if they've improved or not from 2017 to 2018.
## Stock Analysis Using Original Code

By creating a subroutine that sorts thru all the stock data of 2017, we were able to pull the 12 stocks owned by the Greens calculate their returns for each stock. In 2017 almost all of their stocks increased in value.

By 2018, almost all of their stocks were at a loss. 
## Refactored Stock Analysis

By refactoring the subroutine that searched and pulled all the stock data, we were able to decrease the time it took to search and pull the data. 
## Summary
By refactoring the script we were able to pull and sort thru the data by almost a second quicker. While the refactored code is faster, the time it took to refactor for only a few fractions of second was not worth the additional time it took to build.
